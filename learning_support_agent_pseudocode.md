START

Receive project brief, learning objectives, and constraints from lecturer
Receive structured inputs provided by lecturer
(e.g. parameters, constraints, example datasets such as an Excel sheet)

Identify required skills, software tools, and workflow steps
Select a different but thematically similar example project
that does NOT correspond to the assessed student assignment

Execute the example project within the given constraints
using the relevant software tool (e.g. CAD, LTSpice)

For each step of the workflow:
    Demonstrate how the software is used
    Explain the purpose and logic of the step
    Avoid providing solutions or answers to the assessed project

Generate a step-by-step visual learning support demonstration
(e.g. a video showing the execution of the example project)

Submit the generated demonstration to the lecturer for validation
If approved by the lecturer:
    Share the learning support resource with students
Else:
    Revise demonstration according to lecturer feedback
