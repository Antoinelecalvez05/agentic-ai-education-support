# Agentic AI for Feedback and Learning Support

This repository provides conceptual demonstration material for an
AI for Ireland Quest project focused on higher education.

## Project Overview
The project explores the use of agentic, human-in-the-loop AI to:
- support personalised feedback on assessments,
- provide indicative grading as a reference for lecturers,
- improve fairness across multiple graders,
- support learning for technical software (e.g. CAD, LTSpice),
while keeping all academic decisions under lecturer control.

It presents only exploratory prototyping and demonstration purposes.
