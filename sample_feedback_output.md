## Example output (simulated)

Below is a small example of what the feedback agent could produce for one exam question,
based on a verified marking scheme. The lecturer remains responsible for the final mark.

**Question (6 marks):**  
Explain Ohm’s Law and apply it to calculate current when V = 12V and R = 4Ω.

**Verified marking scheme (example):**  
- Define Ohm’s Law in words (2)  
- Provide the formula V = IR (2)  
- Correct calculation I = V/R with correct units (2)

**Student answer (example):**  
"Ohm’s Law is about resistance in a circuit. The current depends on the voltage. I = 12/4 = 4."

**Indicative marking (reference for lecturer):** 4/6

**Feedback to student:**  
- You attempted the calculation, but the correct value is **I = 12/4 = 3A** (and the unit is important).  
- Your explanation is on the right track, but it is too general. To gain full marks, you should clearly state the relationship between voltage, current and resistance.  
- You also needed to write the formula explicitly (**V = IR** or **I = V/R**).

**How to improve:**  
Next time, start by writing the formula, then substitute values and finish with the unit:
I = 12V / 4Ω = 3A.
